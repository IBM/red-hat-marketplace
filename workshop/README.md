# Red Hat Marketplace Jumpstart Workshop

 Red Hat Marketplace is a one-stop-shop to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage enterprise applications across an organizationâ€™s hybrid IT infrastructure, including on-premises and multicloud environments. Red Hat Marketplace gives developers a streamlined view of software that is certified to work in Kubernetes container environments and minimizes red tape for developer managers.

The goals of this workshop are to:

* Familiarize with the best-of-breed toolset to simplify Cloud Native application development on OpenShift.
* Use Red Hat Marketplace to streamline the consumptions and usage of containerized software in a hybrid cloud infrastructure.
