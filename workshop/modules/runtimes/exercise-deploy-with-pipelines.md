## Introduction to Cloud Native Application Development

A recent [study](https://github.com/svennam92/openshift101/tree/ab7f1406831de9aa1a60da349dd5bff8d11f7e13/workshop/study/README.md) by McKinsey & Company reveals that only 20 percent of enterprise applications have moved to the cloud. We believe that a hybrid cloud approach, built on open source and a vibrant open ecosystem, is the best way to move the remaining 80 percent.


The goals of this workshop are:

* To familiarize the reader with OpenShift
* Deploy a Node.js application to OpenShift
* Use OpenShift's features to monitor, scale the application
