### Capabilities

###  OpenShift & the Operator framework
Marketplace uses the Operator Framework, an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications, called Operators, in an effective, automated, and scalable way.

## Onboarding & Software trials
This workshop steps you through the process of onboarding an organization into Marketplace. Using the free trial option, we will do hands-on labs with the software available in the catalog.
