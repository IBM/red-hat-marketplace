# Using CodeReady Containers with Marketplace

## CodeReady Containers

[CodeReady Containers](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview) is the quickest way for developers to get started with OpenShift 4.1 or newer clusters. It is designed to run on a local computer to simplify setup and testing to emulate the cloud development environment locally with all the tools needed to develop container-based apps. 

[Red Hat Marketplace](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/04/27/building-kubernetes-applications-on-openshift-with-red-hat-marketplace/) was created to help developers using Red Hat OpenShift, to build solutions and deploy them across hybrid cloud as well as developer's workstation running CodeReady Containers.

This article will walk you through the steps of setting up the Marketplace and installing containerized products in a CodeReady Container based OpenShift cluster.

### Install CodeReady Containers

CodeReady Containers is delivered as a Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine that supports native hypervisors for Linux, macOS, and Windows 10. This tutorial will use CodeReady Containers v1.11 (with OpenShift 4.5) on Mac.

The install process requires you to login with your Red Hat id and download the CodeReady Containers archive along with the [pull secret](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned) file. Follow the installation instructions as shown in this [article](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/10/16/local-openshift/).


The messages shown below indicate the `crc setup` command completed successfully.

```

#### Start CodeReady Containers

After the setup is complete, start CodeReady Containers by running the command `crc start` or `crc start -p pull-secret.txt`. Ensure your VPN sessions are turned off as this can result in an improper start.

WARN The cluster might report a degraded or error state. This is expected since several operators have been disabled to lower the resource usage. For more information, please consult the documentation
```

Note: 
- Save the login credentials for later use.
- The cluster started in a degraded state. The difference between CodeReady Containers and a production OpenShift cluster is summarized [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.11/html/getting_started_guide/introducing-codeready-containers_gsg#about-codeready-containers_gsg).


Run the command below to ensure the correct `oc` is set up in the path:
```
eval $(crc oc-env)  
```

Verify the cluster is running by running the command  `crc console` to open the cluster console. Login as admin using the credentials from the `crc start` command.

### Install Marketplace Prerequisites

Setting up a `Marketplace account` and a `deployment key` is described in this [article](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/use-marketplace-add-cockroachdb-operator-openshift/).

OpenShift CLI and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) plugins are the other prerequisites to run the Marketplace install script. OpenShift CLI comes with the CodeReady Containers install.

### Add CodeReady Containers Cluster

Login as admin from the command window using the credentials from the `crc start` command.

```
oc login -u kubeadmin -p 8rynV-SeYLc-h8Ij7-YPYcz https://api.crc.testing:6443

The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

Login successful.

You have access to 57 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".
```

Select Workspace > Clusters and click on Add cluster. Enter a name for your CodeReady Containers cluster.

![Add Cluster](images/crc-add-cluster.png)

 Copy the install script command and then click on the `Add Cluster` button.
 Now, run the install script at the command window to install the Marketplace Operator into your cluster.

```
curl -sL https://marketplace.redhat.com/provisioning/v1/scripts/install-rhm-operator | bash -s  <account-id> <cluster-uuid> <deployment-key>

```
Note: 
- The account-id and cluster-uuid are pre-populated and use the deployment-key provisioned from your marketplace account.
- The source code for Marketplace Operator is available at [https://github.com/redhat-marketplace/redhat-marketplace-operator](https://github.com/redhat-marketplace/redhat-marketplace-operator)

Following messages indicate a successful install of the Marketplace operator:

```

Few additional steps are required to make the cluster global pull secret work in CodeReady Containers. 

- Run `oc get secret pull-secret -n openshift-config --output="jsonpath={.data.\.dockerconfigjson}" | base64 --decode` and copy the output.
- Get the node name by running `oc get node`
- Debug the node using `oc debug node/<nodename>` 
- When the debug pod comes up, chroot /host
- Replace the content in '/var/lib/kubelet/config.json' with the output copied earlier from the `oc get secret ..` command.
- `exit` to exit debug pod
- Run `crc stop` and then `crc start`


```
oc get node

NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
crc-m27h4-master-0   Ready    master,worker   9d    v1.17.1

This completes the cluster setup in the Marketplace. Marketplace products are ready to install after the cluster comes up.

### Install product

The marketplace offers a wide variety of products across twelve categories. Let's see how a developer can try Cortex Certifai. 

Create a project `cortex-certifai-test` in your CodeReady Containers cluster.

Go to the [Marketplace catalog](https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us) and search for Cortex Certifai. Select the tile and click on `Free trial` to start your 30 days trial.

![Try Cortex](images/crc-cortexcertifai-trial.png)

Go to `Workspace > My Software` and click on the `Install operator` icon.

![Install Cortex](images/crc-cortexcertifai-tile-install.png)

Select the CodeReady Containers cluster from the list of `Target clusters` and then pick the `Namespace Scope` where the operator should get installed.

![Install Cortex](images/crc-cortexcertifai-install-dialog.png)

Login to the cluster to verify the operator installed successfully.

![Cerify Cortex Install](images/crc-cortexcertifai-install-verify.png)

Proceed to the `Cortex Certifai Operator` tab to install operands or instances for the Cortex Certifai operator.

The operators can be installed directly from the cluster. The Red Hat Marketplace operators become available in the Operator Hub catalog after the Marketplace operator is installed. To install a product directly from the CodeReady Containers, login to the cluster, go to `Operators > OperatorHub`, search and install.

![Cerify Cortex Install from OperatorHub](images/crc-cortexcertifai-install-operatorhub.png)

Note: `Marketplace` should appear as a filter parameter under `Product type` in the OpertorHub search options.


### Uninstalling an Operator

Uninstall the Cortex Certifai operator by selecting the `Uninstall Operator`. The operator for the cluster will automatically delist from the Marketplace product operators page.

![Cerify Cortex Uninstall](images/crc-cortexcertifai-uninstall.png)


### Installing products using CLI commands

This section covers the steps to install E.D.D.I chatbot operator using CLI commands. The general instructions to install an operator is available [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html).
Prior to using CLI install, ensure the entitlement for the software exists in the Red Hat Marketplace.

Disclaimer: The operators installed using the CLI will not show up in the list of installed opertroars in Red Hat Marketplace.

Get the list of Red Hat Marketplace Operators:

```
oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace | grep Marketplace
```

Find the package name for E.D.D.I Operator
```
oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace | grep eddi
eddi-operator-certified                      Certified Operators   16d
eddi-operator-certified-rhmp                 Red Hat Marketplace   16d
```

Describe the package `eddi-operator-certified-rhmp`:
```
oc describe packagemanifests eddi-operator-certified-rhmp  -n openshift-marketplace
```
Use the commands above to gather the information required to generate the `Operator group` and `Operator subscription` yaml files.

Operator group (eddioperatorgroup.yaml):
```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
kind: OperatorGroup
metadata:
  name: eddi-og-redhat-marketplace
  namespace: eddi-trial
spec:
  targetNamespaces:
  - eddi-trial
```

Operator subscritpion (eddisub.yaml):
```
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: eddi-operator-certified-rhmp
  namespace: eddi-trial
spec:
  channel: alpha
  name: eddi-operator-certified-rhmp
  source: redhat-marketplace
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

Install the EDDI Operator:

```
oc apply -f eddioperatorgroup.yaml

operatorgroup.operators.coreos.com/eddi-og-redhat-marketplace unchanged

$ oc apply -f eddisub.yaml

subscription.operators.coreos.com/eddi-operator-certified-rhmp created
```

Ensure the subscription installed properly by running the command:

```
oc describe sub eddi-operator-certified-rhmp -n eddi-trial | grep -A5 Conditions

  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:   2020-06-13T02:36:36Z
    Message:                all available catalogsources are healthy
    Reason:                 AllCatalogSourcesHealthy
    Status:                 False
    Type:                   CatalogSourcesUnhealthy
```

#### Troubleshooting

Commands to troubleshoot CodeReady Containers can be found [here](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.11/html/getting_started_guide/troubleshooting-codeready-containers_gsg)

The error below indicates the necessary entitlement does not exist for the product in Red Hat Marketplace:

```
