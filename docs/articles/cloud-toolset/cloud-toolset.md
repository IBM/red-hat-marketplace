### odo

odo is a fast, iterative CLI for developers who write, build, and deploy applications on OpenShift. Odo is an open source project. It has a simple, extensible syntax that includes on-the-fly interactive help to construct the appropriate options for your commands.

Odo consolidates a series of separate steps to deploy your apps and make modifications. It can automatically check to ensure these changes have been correctly implemented and use the correct syntax. It replaces the oc command-line interface which required a deeper knowledge of OpenShift. Odo also uses the source-to-image (S2I) open-source project to automatically create container images from your source code with a single command line sequence, which automates and consolidates a series of previous manual steps.

### OpenShift Serverless

## DevOps and Security

### OpenShift Pipelines

### CodeReady Toolchain

Open development services for creating, building and testing container applications.

Red Hat CodeReady Toolchain is a set of open services that can be used separately or together.

We will be adding new services to CodeReady Toolchain in the coming months. Most services are available as SaaS or can be deployed to your own private OpenShift install.
