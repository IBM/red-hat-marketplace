* Use the Eclipse Che - Theia based editor to make code changes.
* Define and exectue commands from the workspace.
* Run the project in the debug mode.
* Push the code changes back in the Git repo.
* Customize workspace to meet your project requirements.

`Add or Import Project` , select Git and the repo URL you forked earlier.

```

And fill it out something like this.

You will see this will not result in a new build. If you want to start a manual build you can do so by clicking `Start Build`. We will skip this for now and move on to the webhook part.
