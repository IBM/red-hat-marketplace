# Red Hat Marketplace Jumpstart Workshop

 Red Hat Marketplace is a one-stop-shop to find, try, buy, deploy, and manage enterprise applications across an organizationâ€™s hybrid IT infrastructure, including on-premises and multicloud environments. Red Hat Marketplace gives developers a streamlined view of software that is certified to work in Kubernetes container environments and minimizes red tape for developer managers.

The goals of this workshop are:

* Familiarize with the best-of-breed toolset to simplify Cloud Native application development on OpenShift.
* Use Red Hat Marketplace to streamline the consumption and usage of containerized software in a hybrid cloud infrastructure.

Enterprises who have started their cloud journey and looking at ways to optimize their developer and operational experience will greatly benefit from this workshop.

## Prerequisites
Required: 
- Working knowledge of containers and container orchestration with Kubernetes.
- Workstation or laptop with latest version Chrome or Firefox.

Desired: 
- Knowledge of Kubernetes extensions and operators.
